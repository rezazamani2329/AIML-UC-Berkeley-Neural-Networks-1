# UC-Berkeley--Neural-Networks

## in this project we apply neural networks in differnet datasets and check their performance and prediction. 
**Moreover, we apply LSTM for time series

### process of neural networks in first file (AIML UC Berkeley neural_network1_UC_Berkelry_.ipynb):

- define visualization decision boundaries at first


- using tensorflow, keras and layers to create model with Sequential

- use Dense to create layers

- Apply compile for model

- Fit the model
- Visualize the model for the first time
